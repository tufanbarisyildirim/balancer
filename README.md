# Balancer
Balancing machine that can be plugged anywhere

Balancer helps you to balance jobs/requests/messages between workers.  It is well tested, ready to be used in production under high throughput. 

*Balancer is not a reverse proxy, it is a router so you balance things between any type of UpstreamPool.

Those results are for 10 upstreams where half of them are down but still in pool. (see balancer_test.go for details)
I tired to keep mocking as a real example as possible (Increasing current load, load times and heep half down always). So those results are worst case of finding the best upstream in pool.
